# AIKit Development

This guide covers AIKit development practices, architecture, testing, and contribution guidelines for maintainers and contributors.

## Architecture Overview

AIKit is built with Rust and follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility and performance.

### Core Components

- **CLI Layer**: Command parsing and user interaction
- **Core Services**: Package management, registry operations, agent integration
- **Agent Abstraction**: Unified interface for 17+ AI assistants
- **Package System**: Decentralized package distribution via GitHub

### Key Design Principles

- **CLI-First**: All features accessible via command line
- **Agent Agnostic**: Consistent experience across AI platforms
- **Package-Based**: Extensible through community contributions
- **Git-Native**: Leverages GitHub for distribution and collaboration

## Development Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goaikit/aikit.git
cd aikit
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install Rust and Dependencies">

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Install dependencies
cargo build
```
</Step>

<Step title="Run Tests">

```bash
# Run the test suite
cargo test

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Code Organization

### Source Structure
```
src/
├── cli/           # Command-line interface
│   ├── commands/  # Individual command implementations
│   └── mod.rs      # CLI module definitions
├── core/          # Core business logic
│   ├── agent.rs   # AI agent abstractions
│   ├── package.rs # Package management
│   └── registry.rs # Package registry operations
├── models/        # Data structures
└── main.rs        # Application entry point
```

### Key Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Key Files |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| `cli` | User interaction, command parsing | `mod.rs`, `commands/` |
| `core` | Business logic, external integrations | `agent.rs`, `package.rs` |
| `models` | Data structures, serialization | `config.rs`, `package.rs` |
| `github` | GitHub API integration | `api.rs`, `rate_limit.rs` |

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Located in `tests/` directory
- Test individual functions and modules
- Run with `cargo test`

### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Validate CLI command interactions
- Located in `tests/integration/`

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Run coverage reports with `cargo tarpaulin`

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Rust standard formatting: `cargo fmt`
- Lint with `cargo clippy`
- Use descriptive variable names and comprehensive documentation

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes with tests
4. Run the full test suite: `cargo test`
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Provide detailed description when needed

## Release Process

### Version Management
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update version in `Cargo.toml`
- Tag releases: `git tag v1.2.3`

### Building Releases
```bash
# Build for multiple platforms
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

### Publishing
- Automated via GitHub Actions
- Releases published to GitHub Releases
- Homebrew formula updated automatically

## Troubleshooting Development Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
