# llms.txt

Copy page

AIKit automatically generates an `llms.txt` file to help Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently index and understand our documentation structure. This industry-standard approach improves AI-assisted documentation search and retrieval.

## What is llms.txt?

The `llms.txt` file is an industry standard that helps LLMs index content more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find content relevant to user queries. AIKit automatically hosts an `llms.txt` file at the root of our documentation that lists all available pages in a structured format.

## How it Works

AIKit's `llms.txt` implementation provides:

- **Site title** as an H1 heading
- **Structured content sections** with links and descriptions of each page
- **Alphabetical organization** starting from the root directory
- **Page descriptions** extracted from each page's frontmatter

## AIKit's llms.txt Structure

AIKit organizes documentation into logical sections that mirror our user journey:

## Accessing AIKit's llms.txt

You can view AIKit's `llms.txt` file by appending `/llms.txt` to our documentation site URL:

```
https://docs.aikit.dev/llms.txt
```

The file is automatically updated whenever our documentation changes, ensuring LLMs always have access to the latest information.

## Technical Implementation

AIKit's `llms.txt` implementation:

- **Auto-generated**: Created automatically from documentation structure

- **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes all user-facing documentation pages

## Best Practices for LLM Indexing

### Content Organization
- Clear, descriptive page titles in frontmatter
- Comprehensive descriptions for each page
- Logical grouping of related topics
- Consistent terminology throughout

### Link Structure
- Relative links within documentation
- Clear navigation hierarchy
- Cross-references between related pages
- External links clearly marked

### Content Quality
- Technical accuracy and up-to-date information
- Clear explanations of complex concepts
