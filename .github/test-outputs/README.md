# Test Outputs

This directory contains test run outputs for debugging and CI/CD purposes.

Files in this directory are generated by `scripts/run-tests.sh`:
- `fmt-output.txt`: Output from `cargo fmt --check`
- `clippy-output.txt`: Output from `cargo clippy`
- `test-output.txt`: Output from `cargo nextest run`

These files are tracked in git to help diagnose test failures in CI.
