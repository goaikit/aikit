# Specification Quality Checklist: AIKIT Universal Package System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2024-12-14
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Written for business stakeholders and users
- No technical implementation details mentioned
- All required sections are present and complete

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- All requirements are clear and testable
- Success criteria include specific measurable metrics
- Edge cases identified and documented
- Scope clearly defined with in/out of scope
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly stated

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- User stories are independently testable
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- No implementation details in the specification

## Notes

- This specification successfully captures the AIKIT generalization vision from generalize.md
- All quality criteria have been met without requiring clarification
- Specification is ready to proceed to planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
